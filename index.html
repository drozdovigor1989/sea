              are the greatestanimals one can encounter. We have been traveling around Russia and other
              countries for years, and we have collected all the very best places to meet marine mammals
              close up. We have developed very special routes in the most remote regions of our planet.</p>

                novaeangliae, means "big wing of New England." It refers to their giant pectoral fins,which can grow up
                to 4.8 meters long, and their appearance off the coast of New England, where European whalers first
                encountered them. They have dark backs, light bellies, pleats on their throats, and a small hump in
                front of their dorsal fin, leading to the common name of "humpback."</p>

                          yacht across legendary Spitsbergen, and the mail goal of our expedition is going to be searching for and
                          taking pictures of the Arctic giants - walruses and polar bears. Spitsbergen is covered with snow in May and
                          the ocean around it is full of ice. These are exactly the conditions we need, for we are looking for the
                          giants which depend on ice. Diving will be a part of this program, including a unique experience of diving
                          with the giants of the Arctic. This program is perfect for divers, who will be able to snorkel in the
                          scantily explored waters of the Arctic, for photographers, who will get plenty of chances to take pictures
                          of animals among ice and glaciers, and simply those who adores the North.For the bravest and the most
                          experienced of you we have made it possible to dive with walruses and polar bears. As always, the WWR crew
                          is ready to show you animals as close as it has ever been possible.</p>
                        <p class="main__text">As it always has been, we are going to swim with the whales we come across in the ocean.
                          The long duration of the polar day at Spitsbergen and the fine weather of May (any precipitations or winds
                          are extremely unlikely to occur in this time of year) willallow us to explore the archipelago 24 hours a day
                          if we want to.</p>

                  the
                  most familiar and easily distinguishable of all the whales. Calves are born gray or even brown and

                  fade to white as they become sexually mature around five years of age.
                  Beluga whales have flexible necks, allowing them to move their heads. Their complex communication
                  repertoire of whistles, clicks, and chirps has prompted the nickname “canaries of the sea.”</p>
